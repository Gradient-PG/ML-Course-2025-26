# Gradient ML Course 2025/26 notebooks

This repository contains hands-on **Jupyter Notebooks** designed to help you learn and experiment with key AI and machine learning concepts through practical examples.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the required tools
You will need **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** (or JupyterLab).  
You can install the required package using:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

---

### 2. Running a Notebook

You can start Jupyter locally by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a local web interface where you can browse and run any notebook in this course.

## Recommended Setup: PyCharm

We strongly recommend using **PyCharm’s built-in Jupyter Notebook**, which provides:

* Better code navigation and debugging tools
* Integrated virtual environments
* Seamless execution of notebook cells directly within the IDE

Students have **free access to JetBrains Premium tools**, including PyCharm Professional.
You can claim your free educational license here:
[https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)

After activation, simply open a notebook file (`.ipynb`) in PyCharm — it will automatically switch to notebook mode.

## Structure

Each notebook in this course is designed to help you **practice and explore topics discussed during the lectures**.  
They contain various **tasks**, **exercises**, and **code sections to complete**, allowing you to apply theoretical knowledge in a hands-on way.

Typical notebook contents include:

* **Lecture-related topics** - concepts directly connected to what was covered in class  
* **Theory overview** - a short summary of key ideas and background  
* **Code examples** - working snippets that illustrate the discussed concepts  
* **Exercises to complete** - missing code fragments, functions, or logic you need to fill in  
* **Practice tasks** - small applied challenges or exploratory problems related to the lecture topics

### Learn by doing.

The best way to learn AI is to **build, test, and break things**.
Have fun exploring!
